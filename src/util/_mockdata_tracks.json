Hailing straight from Amsterdam, he's one of the new generation artists coming out of the Dutch capital in the last decade. Former promoter, fantastic dj, and excellent producer Jeff truly knows how to communicate with the audience, both inside the booth and in the studio. One of his most lauded works to date is his 2014 mega track \"Infiltrate\", which catapulted him to the forefront and was played time and time again all across the globe. Last year in 2015 he released an astounding EP on Luke Slater's Mote Evolver, A Figment of His Imagination, further solidifying him as an excellent talent. In 2016 he's released in ARTS and Weekend Circuit, both works being as what's to be expected from him - poignant and exceptional. Mixes from this man come few and apart, so we are very glad to feature one of his rare and extremely superlative hours of techno. This one is most definitely a doozy - Jeff Rushin live in the mix folks.

    "description": "Next on The Erratic Podcast we are happy to welcome aboard a very talented, young artist who has been on our watch-list for a while, HÉCTOR OAKS. Based in Berlin by way of Madrid, he's made quite a name for himself in the last couple of years. In 2014 he joined the KEY imprint and later became part of the Unbroken Booking agency, a established collective of friends and artists from Berlin. Hector has also released superlative works on Sonntag Morgen, Quant, and Mutewax along with a slew of spectacular remixes that have been played by superstar djs around the world. At the start of this year 2016, he founded his own imprint, OAKS, with its first release being one of his strongest works yet. Sound-wise, what is unique about Hector is his uncanny sense of producing truly evoking and outstanding pieces of timeless techno. Powerful, deep, raw and emotive his sound juxtaposes classic and soulful Detroit with Berlin's modern raw and powerful sound, meanwhile infusing his trademark of authentic and enthralling melodies. In this mix for us, he delivers a seminal session full of good old, stomping techno mixed with exquisite, varied textures. This ride is certainly one that will be remembered and relived for times to come. Héctor Oaks in the mix, folks! Enjoy.\n\nwww.unbrokenbooking.com\nwww.facebook.com/hector.oaks\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/hectoroaks\nwww.discogs.com/artist/2965726-Hector-Oaks\n\n\n\n-\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

He's been featured several times before (last one being 2 years ago), and for this occasion he has graciously submitted the recording from his latest DJ set - an event that took place in our own home turf of Brooklyn, hosted by the Aphotic crew, with Claudio PRC as the main headliner. \n\nTim has been very busy in the studio lately playing with different sounds and gear, carving and finessing his own way. His latest endeavor is a fantastic extended EP, titled \"Music For The Ancient\", where a few of his tracks are peppered throughout this mix. Needless to say, we were there in that dark Brooklyn warehouse when this show went down and his entire set was as per usual... smooth and beautiful. We are very glad to once again host Tim on the Erratic Podcast, so without further ado, this is Chanski live in the mix!

Originally from Italy but living in Madrid for very long, in a matter of a few years he's managed to plant himself among the top techno producers, attracting the attention of and being welcomed under the wing and labels of some of the most established and pivotal names in the industry – Dustin Zahn, Len Faki, and Nina Kraviz to name a few. He is also the founder of his own imprint, Involve Records, which just released its 10th installment by the man himself, Salie EP, exploring a lighter yet equally substantial in sound and aesthetics as those which he is known for: raw and driving, acid-filled machine-work techno. Following this fashion, his exclusive mix for us is a combination of all these eclectic sounds. The result? A truly delightful journey evoking in the listener a juxtaposed sense of sheer, dance-floor emotion with intrinsic, visceral electronics. No doubt this one is a doozy folks: Regal in the mix.

Without a doubt, this next hour of delicate and delightful music Joachim submitted for us is no less than a piece of art – regaling the audience with each listen a new adventure, revealing new feelings, delivering new textures. The journey is one of the most unique we've received and you will hear why; we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

ANETHA is a fantastic dj who caught our attention not too long ago and ever since then we've been very eager in awarding her the spotlight on our podcast series. \n\nA resident of Blocaus in Paris, she's made quite a name for herself recently, both on the deejaying and production fronts. Her debut EP \"Ophiucus\" came out last year on Work Them Records, receiving massive accolades and quickly becoming sold out. Much like her dj sets, her production style is characterized by the raw and vibrant, ravey warehouse feel that is filled with so much energy and tension; and the result of each one of her works is supremely elevating. Blending the old-school with the avant-garde, her music is truly evoking and transports the listener to the times every music lover (and dancer), has had on the dancefloor -- where dreams and reality become one -- and after that moment's passed, one cannot but dwell and yearn for reliving it once more. \n\nAnetha's set for us does just that -- sequesters you on a journey through the deepest and rawest corners of your mind and soul... all while cursing the richest and oldest of techno catalogs. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Anetha in the mix. Please Enjoy!\n\nwww.facebook.com/Anetha-395580317184152\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/anetha\nwww.facebook.com/Blocausparis\n\n-\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

The imprint released its sixth EP this past January 2016 and already has amassed impeccable remixes by the likes of Mulero, Orphx, and Svreca, which is a testament to the quality of each contribution to the label.

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the The Erratic Podcast, ENDLEC. Hailing from Greece, he was recently catapulted to the forefront via the Mord powerhouse. Within a year, he’s contributed two spectacular EPs (the last one being a blistering eight-tracker, “Theories and Subjects of Substance”) solidifying him as one of the mainstays. Full of twisted and distorted sounds, his style, both in his productions and stomping dj sets, is a clear reference to the early techno from the 90s, which has been his influence and devotion ever since. For this occasion, he’s delivered an abominable 2-hour mix blending the old with the new, showcasing the dynamism and physicality of his style. Without further adieu, this is Endlec in the mix.

Within five releases, it already boasts the likes of Tensal and Jonas Kopp, each contributing unequivocal four-trackers, the latter slated for release at the beginning of February 2016.

He is a resident at Tresor and co-founder (alongside Audiolouis) of Natch Records, label under which the tremendous Unwise LP was released in 2014. Both the album and remix packages gained critical acclaim and pushed Luca to the forefront. His latest endeavors –– MRI EP for Wunderblock and the second release for his own STK imprint –– are equally phenomenal and can be heard in this mix, recorded live at the intimate Das Lokal in Poland. Luca’s sound is powerful and enveloping, carrying intricate layers of dub throughout. The next 80 minutes are a testament to his sound and style, and we are proud to feature him in the series.

    "description": "Ladies and gentlemen - what we are about to present to you is a podcast episode like none we've had before. It is one of those rare and unique pieces of recorded dance history that we seldom get to experience in their entirety on the dancefloor, much less have the pleasure of reliving from almost beginning to end. For Erratic Podcast 110, we are honored to showcase a whopping 7 hours from THOMAS HESSLER and VINCENT NEUMANN's back-to-back set at the infamous Distillery in Leipzig, Germany. This epic night took place a few weeks ago on Saturday, December 5, 2015 and the journey is unprecedented and extraordinary. We are extremely excited to feature this monster of a mix and hope you enjoy every hour of it as much as we do. Happy Holidays folks! ENJOY :) \n\nwww.facebook.com/ThomasHesslerOfficial\nwww.facebook.com/VincentNeumannLeipzig\nwww.facebook.com/distillery.club\n\n-\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

It comes from Italy from one of the most talented and truly sensational artists out there, CLAUDIO PRC. His approach towards sound is uncanny and his works and projects more than speak for themselves.

We really couldn’t be any more ecstatic to have him be part of the series, especially contributing such a brilliant piece of thought-provoking and awe-striking music worth every single second of it.

Since then, he’s been focusing on his solo projects both under his own name and the iFormat moniker –the latter taking a rawer, more aggressive and industrial version of the sounds and influences he stands for. For us, he was gracious enough to put together an astounding 2-hour studio mix filled with truly wicked, mental techno. Among the many layers and dozens of tracks, you’ll be able to listen to some of Joseph’s unreleased material, as well as his next release on The Cast Project, a new imprint from Berlin.

Hailing from Serbia and composed of Boris Noiz and Darko Kolar, we are huge fans of all their works and are extremely thrilled to have them showcased in The Erratic Podcast. Their mixes come few and apart; are always layered and multi-faceted; and with each one of them they simply out-do themselves by raising the bar to unprecedented levels. Just last month, they released their debut album ‘The Topics’ (a collaboration with British duo, Dronelock), that was released on Shadow Story, the label run by the latter pair. In Ontal's mix for us, you get to sample two of the twelve cuts that make the LP, as well as 26 other tracks, loops, and bits and pieces of astounding, beautiful techno – all surgically mixed into 1 hour of abominable sound, remarkable journey. Undoubtedly, this is for the headiest of heads, the bravest of souls, the strongest of hearts. Ladies and gentleman, this is Ontal live in the mix.

    "description": "For our next episode we have quite a special treat for you – a fantastic and energetic 2-hour mix from the duo behind WUNDERBLOCK, recorded live at Tresor a few weeks ago. Based out of Moscow, Russia, Michael and Vladimir are the heads that teamed up couple of years ago to create the Wunderblock label, specializing on the deeper, dubbier textures of techno. With dozen releases to date, their next EP is from Mas Teeveh with remixes by Brendon Moeller and Takaaki Itoh and might just be their biggest release yet. We are very excited to feature these guys and give them the spotlight in this episode: The next 2 hours deliver an intense rollercoaster ride that instantly transports you to that dark, legendary basement packed with sweaty bodies and stomping bass. This is Wunderblock live from Tresor, folks.

Aside from being a fantastic dj with many years of experience, in 2011 he started his own podcast series called \"Invite's Choice\" – and since then he hasn't looked back. With over 250 episodes to date, it has become one of the most famous and leading purveyors of weekly techno out there. Recently, Tim also released his debut EP \"Active Trigger\" on Knotweed (Philippe Petit's label based out of France), which received massive, heart-felt support. This current year 2015 is also looking very promising for him: he is launching his own imprint, Invite's Choice, with the first release slated for the summer; and the first Invite's Choice night is taking place the first week of May at Closure in Amsterdam. For the occasion, he delivered over 90 minutes of exquisite techno, showcasing his excellent mixing skills and sheer quality all-around. As always, sit back and let the music do the rest. Ladies and gents, this is Invite in the mix.

Jeroen has been keeping busy in the studio - releasing his debut album \"Crux\" on his brand new label, Radial Records, and picking up producing with his long-time studio partner, Anton Pieete, under the Museum pseudonym. In the next hour, Jeroen's showcases his powerful sound and versatile style providing a simply stomping studio session through a varied and cohesive techno story. This one hits hard on many levels.

He's been honing his sound and style for close to two decades and running his own label, Owls, for the better part of this time. In 2012 he came out with an exceptional EP, Slicer/Spacer, taking the techno community by storm, followed with equally robust works across Planet Rhythm, Modularz, and Grey Report. Known for his fast, hard, and layered style of mixing, his contribution for us is a much deeper, highly cerebral, journey through the darker and introspective realms of his modern sound. Needles to say, we absolutely love it. And we are confident you will too. Here it goes folks, for the next hour this is Takaaki in mix.

This astounding mix features the flavor of techno they always seek and enjoy mixing: blistering, straight-up, no non-sense techno. As you know by now, when it comes to having these two behind the decks there's not much else to say than just letting the music do the talking. Beware, this is not for the faint of heart! With this said, \"Thank You\" for tuning in, episode after episode, and we hope you enjoy this installment as much we do. Ladies and gentleman, the Erratic Founders in the mix.

Since a few years ago though, he has been delivering top-notch, no-nonsense techno under his CTRLS alias for Token. Also, having dabbled as one-half the Northern Structures duo, Troels' background is versatile and extensive (including a long affair with Drum & Bass). It is due to all this history that his mixes are unique and quite extraordinary. What he put together for us is no doubt an astounding 80-minute journey rich with all kinds of multifaceted techno. Cursing the raw, the harsh, and the pounding - it is a distinct pleasure to have Troels be part of the podcast. Without further adieu, this is Ctrls.

Without a doubt, every single set from him is unique and carries a degree of texture and richness that is just truly unrivaled. Rightly so, his label (a mixture of IDM, techno, and electronica in its 8th year run) has amassed and released one of the best electronic music catalogues out there. On this contribution for us, the journey (recorded live in Japan) is equally as enveloping as penetrating, taking you to places where your mind can't do but wander – in sheer amazement. But nothing tells the story better than music itself, so begin the voyage and lose yourself in it. This is Svreca, folks.

He has been cultivating his unique and powerful sound for well over a decade now and his platform is soon turning 10 years, spanning more than 50 releases and including the very best names in techno. For us, Jose decided to go back to basics (leaving behind the computer and controllers) and manned-up a fantastic and very special 3-deck episode weaved together on two 1200s and a CDJ. The result is remarkable, if we say so ourselves, and the journey is nothing short of exemplary. We are extremely grateful for this contribution and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

    "description": "Born and raised in the US but now settled in the UK, we have the pleasure of welcoming one of the finest and purest techno laureates the genre has to offer, DJ SKIRT. Her approach and style are truly unique and reflective – she doesn’t just write music, but carves in time her artistic thoughts and emotions; she doesn’t just mix music, but more importantly blends and molds the rhythmic life of records, meticulously, within and between each other, sincerely. This latter feat is a reflection of her love and passion towards the purist approach of delivering her musical voyages – via vinyl, and vinyl only. No doubt, she takes great pride in all the music that she touches, and it shows. Her mixes are selective and come few and apart, each one of them having a pulse and character of its own. For us, the journey she unraveled is one of awe, depth, and breathtaking beauty. This is Skirt for the next hour.

    "description": "Next on the series, we are proud to welcome one of the Finnish techno stalwarts, SAMULI KEMPPI. He is behind the acclaimed Deep Space Helsinki radio show as well as the label, under the same name, both run and co-founded alongside Juho Kusti. For the past decade, Samuli has been releasing his take of top-notch, icy, minimalesque techno across many of the best labels (Mote, Perc, M_Rec, Komisch, Balans). For us, he contributed the entire hour of 100% hardware techno performed live at Flow Festival in Helsinki last month. The set is full of fresh material and at 132 beats-per-minute, it twists and turns pushing through layers of trippy, rhythmic techno… all arranged live. As he called it himself – \"132 bpm voodoo techno.\" Ladies and gentlemen, this is Samuli Kemppi Live.

Being an artist of high stature, he has toured the world over representing the heaviest of techno labels (CLR, Sleaze, Credo), pushing his brand of deep, dark, banging techno. His enthusiasm and dedication towards the shows and the music is really admirable and contagious; aside from smashing dancefloors wherever he goes, he also films and recaps his visits around the globe with wit, charm and zeal. For us, he kindly provided the first two hours of his recent 5-hour marathon set at Crobar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a few weeks back. The journey is unique, powerful, and performed live with loops and layers of sheer, pounding bass. As Alex usually announces in the promo videos leading up to his gigs, \"unfortunately, he has no house for you.\" ENJOY!\n\nwww.alexbau.de\nwww.twitter.com/alexbautechno\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/alexbau\nwww.youtube.com/user/alexbautechno\nwww.discogs.com/artist/54144-Alex-Bau\nwww.facebook.com/pages/alex-bau/128175640006\n\n-\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

This was his first time visiting these cities and all the events and performances were, no doubt, best in class. From Trouw to Awakenings, Tresor to Berghain, everything that was said about these techno havens was true, and then some. \n\nThis is what his aim in this episode was – to relive all the sounds and textures, creating a deep and intense journey to transport the listener to all that was experienced abroad... tension, excitement, uncertainty, ecstasy, and absolution. This is LoKKoTRONN in the mix, folks.

    "description": "We are supremely excited to present our brand new guest in the series - someone whom we have been seeking out for a while and who truly is an eclectic artist in the purest sense of the word: a musician, a DJ, a producer, a label owner, and a photographer among others; he is the enigmatic <a href=\"http://brandolupi.wix.com/brando-lupi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BRANDO LUPI</a>. &#13;\n&#13;\nHe delves in the underground and every piece of art he produces (be it a techno mix, <a href=\"http://www.official.fm/tracks/tQyD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a rock song</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1hfPcr8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a film soundtrack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pARYeqQ1Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ambient electronica</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/brandolupi/4536480154/in/set-72157629969553343\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a photograph</a>), always carries an esoteric stamp exuding organic mastery and genuine purpose, both of which are the result of the urgency in self-expression only artists like Brando can experience. With this said, the next 72 minutes are just that - a moment of reflection and inspiration - taking the listener on an introspective and stunning journey through the deep, intricate layers of techno.

    "description": "Our next episode is yet again a unique, one-off installment showcasing a veteran of the New York techno scene and a man who during the early 90s pioneered and helped push the sound of this city out to the world, STEVE STOLL. &#13;\n &#13;\nThis exclusive mix is a brief overview of his label, <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/label/224-Proper-NYC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Proper NYC</a>, in order to commemorate its 20th anniversary. Steve wanted to dedicate this journey to his friend and producer, <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/1374018-V1nz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vincent Capuano (V1NZ)</a>, who is no longer with us, as well as the artwork featured here to <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/1910-Pete-Namlook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pete Namlook</a>, which was taken from his latest album, <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Steve-Stoll-Zero-Point-crossings/release/1205807\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Point Crossings</a>, on Fax Records.&#13;\n &#13;\nThis a one-of-a-kind contribution, trailing the old-school, the minimal, and the raw, pure techno sound coming out of Proper NYC during the 90s. We are very grateful to be able to showcase this and we thank Steve for taking time out of parenthood and the American Midwest (where he and his family reside currently), to bring us this piece of frozen time.&#13;\n &#13;\nAt last, we strongly suggest you check his latest album, <a href=\"http://psychonavigation.bandcamp.com/album/steve-stoll\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Praxis</a>, released this past January on Psychonavigation, which is a superlative ambient composition spanning 16 tracks and dedicated to the work of the following 3 electronic pioneers – <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Oram\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Daphne Oram</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Delia Derbyshire</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Spiegel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Laurie Spiegel</a>.&#13;\n &#13;\nThis is Steve Stoll live (recorded in one take exclusively for Erratic) celebrating 20 Years of Proper NYC.

This time at the helm we have the riveting Dutch duo, ABSTRACT DIVISION, featuring part of their live set recorded a few weeks back at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/179143955616096/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Evolution</a> in Utrecht, Netherlands. &#13;\n&#13;\nPaul Boex and Dave Miller are the veteran minds behind the project and their combination, marrying quality with experience from both ends, culminates in an extremely refined style. All of their productions, released mostly on their own <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/label/123705-Dynamic-Reflection\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dynamic Reflection</a> founded by Paul back in 2008, are sophisticated, evoking, and ethereal – both for the mind and the body. In their own words: <i>“intelligent, dancefloor-oriented techno in its purest form.”</i> We are very glad to have them be part of the series. This is Abstract Division live, folks.

An artist whose music productions in techno are nothing but extraordinary, much of his musical influences stem from the EBM, Industrial and Synthpop genres from the 70s and 80s.

With a tracklist that spans more than 30 years of history across these genres, this is a collection of time.&#13;\n&#13;\nTRACKLIST&#13;\n&#13;\n01. The Klinik - Burning Inside (1987)&#13;\n02.

This <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpgt00r7t1s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">live performance</a> was one of its kind as it explores live sound arrangement and manipulation (100% improvised), which is the concept and setup they specialize at the moment, aspiring to take it even further. We are truly humbled by the opportunity of hosting these amazing and very talented guys on this special occasion and releasing this extremely organic and experimental live session. &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nProduction-wise, their <a href=\"http://hardwax.com/68961/woo-york/grad-ep/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Grad EP</a> released mid-last year was received exceptionally well, which included superb remixes by Jeroen Search, Deepbass, and Ness (all past guests in this series). For this year, they already have a slew of 12\" planned across Soma (first one coming out <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152096702706912&amp;set=vb.40084081911&amp;type=2&amp;theater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this month</a>), Audio Assault, and Fullpanda. Aside from keeping themselves busy in the studio, they plan to continue performing their refined live-act while creating new sounds and textures. With this said, we hope you enjoy the following 55 minutes of mind-blowing, abstract, futuristic music as much as we do.&#13;\n&#13;\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/woo.york.official\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WOO YORK's Facebook Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/wooyork\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WOO YORK's Resident Advisor Page</a>&#13;\n-&#13;\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.&#13;\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

    "description": "There is really not much to say about our next guest that hasn't been said before - born and bred in LA, started DJing in his teens, part of the long-standing Droid family, techno prodigy and current forerunner in the genre, alter ego extraordinaire.... we are talking about TRUNCATE.&#13;\n&#13;\nMost commonly know as Audio Injection, as well as for his pivotal affiliation across Droid and CLR over the last 5+ years, he came up with the Truncate alias and project 2 years ago. This was intended to be more of a personal outlet for him to release a deeper, funkier, Detroit-influenced, and stripped-down version of techno, but it has taken the techno community by storm since. From releases to remixes, gigs to podcasts, shirts to stickers, his alter ego is currently at an all-time high, and we are delighted David took time from his busy schedule to put together this exclusive studio mix for us.&#13;\n&#13;\nAs you are about to listen, the next hour is the epitome of what his project is all about - deep, jackin', rhythmic techno - that grabs you by the core and it is as much of a body workout as it is the minds. Without further adieu, ladies and gentlemen, this is Truncate. &#13;\n&#13;\nENJOY!&#13;\n&#13;\n-&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/truncate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TRUNCATE's Resident Advisor Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://truncate.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TRUNCATE's Bandcamp Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AudioInjection.LA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AUDIO INJECTION's Facebook Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.audioinjection.com \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AUDIO INJECTION's Web Page</a>&#13;\n-&#13;\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.&#13;\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

    "description": "Episode 56 comes from Detroit's Blank Code label founders and DJ/producing duo, PROJECT 313. Composed of Nick Bien and Chad Parraghi, they have been active in Detroit across multiple projects dating back to the 90s. In 2007, they founded the <a href=\"http://www.blankcode.com \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Blank Code</a> platform, focusing mostly on event promotions, with the label coming to fruition 18 months ago. Since then, it has taken off, with them signing a slew of heavy-hitters: their sixth and latest EP, <a href=\"http://www.beatport.com/release/strumpet/1189534\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Strumpet</a>, features Drumcell, Material Object and Brendon Moeller.&#13;\n&#13;\nThey are also the curators of the Underground Stage at Detroit's Movement Festival in next year's edition, May 24-26, 2014 (in which they already took a big part <a href=\"http://dubmonitor.com/movement-2013-day-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this year</a>). For the third consecutive year, they will partner up with Droid from LA to deliver another Interface/Scene after-party boasting yet again a breathtaking lineup (their <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?468081\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">last after party event</a> consisted of 14 acts, across 3 rooms, in just 1 night). &#13;\n&#13;\nMusically, we are proud to showcase their distinct style, characterized by deep and intricate layers of dub, bass, and minimalist techno. The next 100 minutes is a live recording from when they played a live set at <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?501719\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Oktave's 4-Year Party</a> in Chicago last month: slow-building and ever-hypnotic, so listen and enjoy.

Between his private life and busy touring schedule, he was kind enough to weave together an stunning, top-of-the-class, and exclusive 2-hour journey for us, which we couldn't be any more grateful for it. We have no doubt you will think the same. There really is not much else to say on this one except to let the music speak for itself. Just keep in mind that his inaugural release on Mord, <i>Linea Recta</i>, is inside, and it's outstanding.&#13;\n&#13;\n<a href=\"http://basmooy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BAS MOOY's Website</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bas-Mooy/42327934944\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BAS MOOY's Facebook Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/basmooy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BAS MOOY's Resident Advisor DJ Page</a>&#13;\n&#13;\n-&#13;\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.&#13;\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

    "description": "Continuing representing local talent, in this episode we are very proud to present veteran DJ, talented producer, event co-founder, radio host, and close friend of Erratic, CRAFT. Man of many trades, Daniele Ciocio epitomizes true passion and unyielding dedication: he’s been DJing since his teens, producing for over a decade, promoting events for 7+ years, and hosting his own radio/podcast show, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/feedtheraver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Feed The Raver</a>, since 2012 ––his most recent endeavor.&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nHis repertoire includes releases on Freitag, Hidden Recordings, Subtrak, Kaputt, and most recently, Reloading, to name just a few. The contribution to the latter was released just last month and mastered by Audio Injection, and has already received massive praise and chartings across the top names in the industry. This remix, titled Steady Balance, is included in this excellent 60-minute mix he surgically put together for us ––an introspective journey through the deep, the dark, and the cerebral. And we are extremely thankful for it. So Enjoy!&#13;\n&#13;\nTRACKLIST&#13;\n01. Alan Backdrop - Nohim (Save The Planet Earth)&#13;\n02. Marcel Dettmann - Range&#13;\n03.

He is more widely known as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/ATrebor/219020924796337\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alejandro Trebor</a>, with releases across Trapez, Nachstrom, and Hidden Recordings among others, while The Plant Worker debuted last year with a fantastic and acclaimed release on Detroit’s Blank Code, Beta EP.\n \nIn this podcast, he presents us with 1-hour of straight pounding, bass-driven, no nonsense techno, showcasing his new ego and the Detroit-influence style. Navigating craftily through the industrial, the acid, and the banging he delivers flawless and surgical mixing.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThePlantWorker?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">THE PLANT WORKER's Facebook Page</a>\n-\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

His name fittingly represents the essence and rhythm of this 1-hour techno hecatomb and includes a stellar tracklist with brand new material, as he says: <i>“from myself, my friends, and some artists I'm loving at the moment, and some older stuff for good measure, a good example of the kind of stuff I play in my live shows.”</i>&#13;\n &#13;\nDarren has been busy in the studio, recently releasing the Analysis EP on Aconito Records (which is superb and in this mix) along with another EP on his own label, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/InformaRecords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Informa Records</a> (INFORMA006), with an original track by his friend Hironori Takahashi, a remix by Deepbass, and a still-undisclosed guest remixer. Also due on Informa will be a yet-to-be-announced Deepbass collaborative project. In addition, Darren has remixes coming out for Bleak on the new Glasgow-based label, Animal Farm Records, as well as for Lui Urbano on Ketra Records. And he is finalizing, as we speak, the 3rd Deepbass &amp; Ness collaboration.&#13;\n&#13;\nTRACKLIST&#13;\nAsyncron - Tempelhof (Milton Bradley Remix)&#13;\nMarcel Dettmann - Range&#13;\nDeepbass - Analysis X.Y.02&#13;\nGiorgio Gigli - Reflections&#13;\nRrose - The Surgeon General&#13;\nBleak - Synonym (Deepbass remix)&#13;\nShifted - Trouble&#13;\nFumiya Tanaka - Barthazar&#13;\nSeverin - Halo&#13;\nAttemporal &amp; Ness - Undefined Time Lapse&#13;\nConrad Van Orton - Continuous Deception&#13;\nMike Storm - No Contact&#13;\nStaffan Linzatti - Repetition&#13;\n-&#13;\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Deepbass/106339422751176?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DEEPBASS' Facebook Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/deepbass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DEEPBASS' Resident Advisor Page</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Deepbass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DEEPBASS' Discogs Page</a>&#13;\n-&#13;\nErratic is comprised of a small team of passionate curators hosting proper Techno parties in New York City.&#13;\nwww.ErraticNYC.com | www.fb.com/ErraticNYC",

Being always strongly impregnated by music, in mid-2000 he became a regular DJ at Cocoliche, the only Techno club in Buenos Aires. There is where he met his first heavyweight artists from the Techno international and national scene.&#13;\n&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.krillmusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Krill Music</a> is a young Argentinean label founded in late 2011, when it debuted with the <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=10007\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">'Transparent / Anklad'</a> by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/AnD/139500879474982\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AnD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JonasKoppMusic?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Kopp</a>. Throughout the year, the label has released three albums and promises to play an important role in the future of the Argentinian Techno scene. For its fourth release, the label welcomes the young artist from Italy, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/raffaele.attanasio2?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Raffaele Attanasio</a>, who in turn introduces his new pseudonym 'X501' and a 'Bleak' Rework.

This comes as a special 2-hour recording extracted from their live US debut in New York City a couple weeks back, where they took the privileged crowd on a 5-hour journey.&#13;\n&#13;\nCurrently collaborating virtually across Britain and Scotland, they established their own imprint, FSG, in 2008 and have recently received tremendous praise on their paramount projects on Perc Trax and Stroboscopic Artefacts, catapulting their visibility to the forefront of the Techno community. Their sound is abstractly dense and industrially pounding, and that's precisely what you will experience in this live set. Here they showcase their uncanny penchant towards Techno on a dynamic marathon of new and unreleased productions, alongside classic gems.
