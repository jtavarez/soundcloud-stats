# Pure Stats

Soundcloud statistics for any public account.

**Link**: [jtavarez.github.io/soundcloud-stats](https://jtavarez.github.io/soundcloud-stats)


Built with React and using the Soundcloud API. Allows anyone to quickly see statistics for soundcloud accounts across all their public tracks. Soundcloud provides a nice aggregrate view of these numbers but there is no easy way to compare numbers between tracks. Plus this works with other users as well.

**Note**: Because of limitations with Soundcloud's own API, some users won't be accessible here. This will typically be the case with larger accounts, and there doesn't seem to be a way around that. But you can try :)

##### Still to come:
* More browser testing (Chrome currently the preferred choice)
* Fancy loading indicator
* Unit tests
